30 minute interview

Senior React.js Developer Interview Question and Answers.

1. Tell me about yourself?

I am a core UI Developer with 12+ years of experience building .com websites for different organizations using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular 18, React.js, and Redux. 
In the past 2 years, I worked on the React migration team, where I converted the .net pages to react on united.com. 
Frontend is React, and used ATMOS (Own library) components used company wide.

Worked on Security features for users where they can manage there account like Forgot password, Forgot MileagePlus number, 
security questions, Sign-in features, Miles-Pooling, United Club pass,  Recent Activity, dashboard updates and 
KTN(Known Traveler Number), Accessibility guidelines features on united.com.

used middleware such as redux-saga to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, data fetching, and impure actions in a more organized and efficient way.

The new initiative worked on Miles-Pooling( points you get after traveling), TSA Precheck, Account security and management features, and Under18.

Previously worked with Accelerator team for Visa Inc. remediation of MBDA modules like Application Management, Account Management, Portfolio Management, Analytics, Recurring billing, Virtual Terminal, etc for bank users like Wells Fargo,  Bank of America, etc

Capital Group worked on DAVIS Project. Davis stands for Data visualization where we build different highcharts using react and integrate into the AEM., the backend is Java. Previously I worked on Creative Workbench, a writing tool where articles are published on capital group websites.

At Cerner Corporation worked on the medical examination forms.

In Office Depot worked on black Friday reporting.

Satinos Technologies created a tax portal and a schoomin website for the Vignan schools.


2. React Hooks: Hooks are functions that enable functional components to manage state and lifecycle features, providing a more concise and expressive way to handle component logic.

3. What are the popular hooks in react and explain it's usage?

useState: Manages state in functional components.
useEffect: Manages side effects in functional components.
useContext: Consumes context in functional components.
useReducer: Manage state with a reducer function, For More complex state management.
useRef: Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
useCallback: performance improvement usecase
useMemo: performance improvement usecase.

4. How can you Optimize Performance in React application?
1. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback:  Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2. Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment: Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes.
3. Lazy loading with React.lazy: Use it to load components lazily, reducing the intial bundle size and imporving intial loading performance.
4. Code splitting: Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times.
5. Optimizing Images and Assets:  Compress and optimize images, use responsive images and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead.


5.  Difference between virtual DOM and real DOM?
Suppose line of code is changed , processing is done on particular line. It will process the whole code in real DOM. Virtual DOM is faster.

6. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. 
It helps to you write applications, run in different environments and easy to test. 
And simply we called as Redux is a state management tool.
Components in redux
Actions -->Input Parameters Ex: Deposit and Withdraw money from ATM
Store --> Main Server
Reducers --> Business Logic
Dispatch --> Request
Subscribe --> Response
State --> Store Component Data

7. What is state management in react application? 3rd party module, with redux.
Redux? We have redux thux, redux saga.
What is redux thunx, redux saga? Inorder to manipulate the store Actions(request, response).
Redux thunx is an outdated library.
Saga is Advanced library.

Why Saga? In sagas debouncing is available by default.

8. Explain React lifecycle methods?

React component lifecycle has three categories – Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.
Mounting – Birth of your component
Update – Growth of your component
Unmount – Death of your component

React Component LifeCycle Hooks

        1. constructor
        2. componentWillMount()
        3. render()
        4. componentDidMount()
        5. componentWillReceiveProps()
        6. shouldComponentUpdate()

        // component kill methods

        7. componentWillUpdate()
        8. componentDidUpdate()
        9. componentWillUnmount()

Recently Added LifeCycle Hooks

Context API, useEffect, useState --- Newly added version by version

Explanation:

# Constructor()

        constructor will execute at booting time of component --constructor will execute only once
        Define state in constructor

# componentWillMount()

        componentWillMount() will execute after constructor
        componentWillMount() will execute only once
        in general we will do the initial modifications in state
        in general we will set global parameters like width, height

# render()

        after componentWillMount() automatically render() function will execute
        render() is mandatory lifecycle hook(main lifecycle hook)
        in general, we will place presentation logic in render()
        when ever change detected in state or props automatically this lifecycle hooks will execute

# componentDidMount()

        after render function immediately componentDidMount() life cycle hook will execute
        in general we will make asynchronous calls in ComponentWillMount()
        this is recommended state to change the state of component

# componentWillReceiveProps()

        when component will receive props from redux

# shouldComponentUpdate()

        if we want to update the state return "true" else "false"

# UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()

        death method --> perform cleanup operations

# componentDidUpdate()

        if we integrate any third party UI elements
        plugin logic will write here

# componentWillUnmount()

        Before killing the component componentWillUnmount is executed.
        death method --> perform cleanup operations


9. Call() -- if we want to create second memory location will interact with 1st memory location.

Apply – if we want to pass array instead of independent parameter

Bind() - merge memory location 1 and memory location 2 -->merge 2 memory locations-->new memory location.

What is the USE? Call function advanced function APPLY, call and apply advanced version is bind().
Purpose is same. Call, bind, apply –used to access 2 objects in different memory location

10. What is the current ES version? ES6 -2015, ES9, JS24

11. What are different positions in CSS ?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static: HTML elements are positioned static by default.

relative: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

fixed: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

absolute: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

sticky: An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.


12. What is shallow copy and deep copy? 

A shallow copy creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object for nested properties. 
This means changes to nested objects in the copy will affect the original object.

javascript example: 
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const shallowCopy = { ...originalObject };

shallowCopy.b.c = 3;
console.log(originalObject.b.c); // Output: 3

Deep Copy
A deep copy creates a new object with new memory locations for all nested properties, ensuring changes to the copy don't affect the original object.

JavaScript Example:

javascript
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

deepCopy.b.c = 3;
console.log(originalObject.b.c); // Output: 2
